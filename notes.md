## Big question
* Are there Hamiltonian chordal graphs on fewer than 15 vertices which are not cycle extendable?

#### Chordal
* a graph with no induced cycle with at least 4 vertices
* has a perfect elimination ordering iff it is chordal

#### Induced
* created by deleting vertices.

#### Cycle Extendable
* a graph \delta with a cycle v0, v1 ... vr, c, we say c extends if \delta contains a cycle with r+2 vertices r+1 of which are v0, v1 .. vr.
* \delta is cycle extendable iff every cycle on at most |V(\delta)| - 1 vertices extends.

#### George Hendry 1989 or 1990
* Conjecture: Every Hamiltonian chordal graph is cycle extendable.
* 2013 ish Laford Simmore proved the conjecture false on 15 and more vertices


#### Filter
( n - 1 choose 2 ) + 1 edges : Any more and it is cycle extendable
