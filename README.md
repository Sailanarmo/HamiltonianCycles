## Finding All Hamiltonian Cycles on Chordal Graphs

This repository is to help ourselves and others find all Hamiltonian cycles using Dr. Brendan McKay's Nauty Software and Algorithm's. All credit of the directory Nauty belongs solely to the work of Dr. Brendan McKay who's software can be found here: http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/



The progam cycleFinder.cpp will take an input file of space separated adjacency matrices, where each adjacency matrix is set off from the others with a new line. The program will ask for the number of vertices and the file to read from, these can be given as command line arguments as well following the form [vertices] [filename].
